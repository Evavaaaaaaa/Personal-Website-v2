Hey! I know this is a SUPER LONG page, so, I've created a special quote generator that would randomly pick one of the annotations I made and give it to you as a gift. Try it out here (desktop version is preferred): [Generate your quote of the day!](/quotes)

"However, this reopens the possibility of the weak anthropic principleâ€”     that is, that we coexist with many dead universes, and that ours is the      only one
compatible with life.     The second controversy stimulated by Hawking's wave function of     the universe is much deepe r and in fact is still unresolved. It is   called     the Schrodinger's cat problem. "

"because it has no predictive power, nor can it be tested. "


2024-04-05 17:04:09
"This takes us to the "strong" version of the      anthropic principle, which states that all the physical constants of the     universe have been precisely chosen (by God or some Supreme Being)     so that life is possible in our universe. "

"However, if we could somehow shrink the lifetime of the proton to sev  eral
million years, then life would be impossible. Ther e would not be      enough time to create life out of random collisions of molecules. "


2024-04-05 16:53:43
"To have life in the universe, you need a rare conjunction of many coincidences.   "


2024-04-05 16:49:37
"Since space and time can exist      only on each bubble, there is no such thing as space and time between      the bubbles.   "




2024-04-05 16:49:33
"Normally, each soap bubble is like a universe unto itself, except     that
periodically it bumps into anothe r bubble, forming a larger one , or      splits into two smaller bubbles. The difference is that each soap bubble      is now an entire ten-dimensional universe. "




2024-04-05 16:48:06
"Hawking's quantum cosmology also      assumes that the wave function of the universe allows these universes to      collide. Wormholes can develop and link  these universes.   "




2024-04-05 16:46:44
"is to verify this conjecture     mathematically, to show that the wave function of the universe is large     for our present universe and vanishingly small for other universes. "



2024-04-05 16:45:30
"According to this picture, the wave function of the universe spreads     out over
all possible universes.   "




2024-04-05 16:43:24
" parallel universes, the wave function of the universe. "




2024-04-05 16:42:23
"Hawking's new idea was to treat the entire universe as though it were      a
quantum particle.   "




2024-04-05 16:41:21
"However,     some of the cloud would spread out over all space, out to Mars and even      beyond the solar system "




2024-04-05 16:40:45
" Thus by simply looking at a thundercloud, we can rapidly      estimate the
probability of finding large concentrations of water and     dust in certain parts of the sky.      "




2024-04-05 16:40:38
"The starting point of quantum theory, we recall, is a wave function      that
describes all the various possible states of a particle.    "





2024-04-05 16:39:25
"Hawking, starting as a pur e classical relativist     rather than a quantum theorist, approaches the problem from the other      point of view.    "




2024-02-23 10:50:51
"Quantum theory, by contrast, is a theory of the microcosm, where sub  atomic particles are held together by particlelike forces dancing on the      sterile stage of space-time, which is viewed as an empty arena, devoid of      any content. "




2024-02-23 10:49:37
"could predict all the chemical properties of matter found in the uni  verse. To    them, chemistry would no longer be a fundamental science.      From now on, it would be "applied physics."      "




2024-02-23 10:49:29
"quantum physicists such as Paul A. M. Dirac were declaring that all of chemistry could be derived from first principles.    "





2024-02-23 10:48:31
"What is matter made of? What holds it infinite variety of forms, such as gases,  ceramics, glasses, lightning bolts, stars,



together? Why does it come in an metals, rocks, liquids, crystals,
and so on?     T h e new theory was


christened quantum mechanics, and gave us the	first comprehensive
formulation with which to pry open the secrets of	the atom.   "

" The energy     necessary to probe this tiny distance can be computed, and it is called     the Planck energy, or 10    1 9         billion electron volts.    "




2024-02-23 10:46:07
"Oskar Klein made several improvements on the theory, stating that per  haps the quantum theory could explain why the fifth dimension rolled      up.    "




2024-02-23 10:45:01
" As they moved per  pendicular to Lineland, they would encounte r an infinite numbe r of      parallel line worlds that coexisted with their universe "




2024-02-23 10:43:54
" In fact, Kaluza's theory raised mor e      questions than it answered. Th e
obvious question to ask Kaluza was:      Wher e is the fifth dimension? Since all earthly experiments showed con  clusively that we live in a universe with three  dimensions of space and      one of time, the embarrassing question still
remained.      "




2024-02-23 10:43:34

"and gravity, you will not achieve anything because there is still the      nuclear force." He realized that the nuclear force was outside Kaluza  Klein theory "




2024-02-23 10:40:15
"For the first time, someone had found a use for the      fourth spatial dimension:
to unite the laws of physics!   "




2024-02-12 10:53:22
"However, according to special relativity, time can beat at      different rates, depending on how fast one is moving. Time being the      fourth dimension    means that time is intrinsically linked with movement      in space.    "




2024-02-12 10:51:33
"Th e meaning     of time as being the fourth dimension is that time and space can rotate      into each other in a mathematically precise way.   "




2024-02-12 10:51:14
"to rotate an object by 90 degrees, we can turn its length into width and      its
width into depth.   "
