Hi, I’m Eva — curious about how people think, how systems work, and how stories are told.

#### A bit about me
I currently work in healthcare market research, where I spend my days navigating data, people, and questions with no easy answers.

Outside of work, I like tinkering with small digital projects, writing loosely structured thoughts, and finding quiet joy in good design and well-made tools. 

#### What can you find here?
This site is a place for me to collect, experiment, and reflect — slowly, and in no particular order.
