Today I made a handful of updates — a mix of design tweaks, new content, and small but meaningful improvements that make the site feel more like me.

---

## 🖼️ Updated Profile Photo

Swapped out the avatar for a new one and updated the path in `config.toml`.  

---

## 📱 Mobile Typography Fix

To improve readability on phones, I added a media query that reduces the base font size on smaller screens. Now text scales more gently and feels better to scroll through on mobile.

---

## 💻 Code Styling

Refreshed the look of code blocks to reflect a VS Code light theme — soft white background, subtle shadows, and new palette.  
Tweak the look of inline code ———— they now feel lighter, calmer, and easier to read.

---

## 🔗 Social Links on About Page

Added links to a few places where I share things outside this site

---

## 🧶 About & Gallery Introductions

Wrote new intros that better reflect the spirit of the site:
- The **About** page now ends with a warm invitation to connect
- The **Gallery** has a short, poetic note — quiet, honest, and open

---

> Time Spent: 3 hr

## What's next?

1. The font size of the tag list is not responsive and a bit large overall.

That’s it for today. Small things, but they make the space feel a little more mine.

Thanks for being here. :)
