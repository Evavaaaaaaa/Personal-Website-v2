# [2025/5/31] About Inspiration
Human aim to preserve knowledge via various format. Thus the later generation could build upon their legacy and achieve something greater *faster*. Knowledge preserved could be used by: (1) Using it as underlying assumption and prove a new theory, (2) modifying the original knowledge and create a new theory, and (3) using the knowledge to build tools that create a new theory. The ultimate goal is to create something better for the human spieces to survive. However, knowledge is not accessible to anyone at anytime. The segregation of knowledge made knowledge itself into a form of authority and power. And thus, *how* knowledge is preserved reflects a social token. It could be locked into restricted libraries, or written in a way that powers authority. So, when we are gaining knowledge, we are not only gaining a survival kit, but also are we constructing our social identity, or how we would explain the world around us. 

In other words, if an individual is creating something that allows others to learn, to build upon or to construct their social identity, that individual is, to some extent, building knowledge. To do better work, knowledge should be carefully crafted. But to construct social identity, knowledge could be a loosely form of art that inspires the audience. As much as I would like to argue that one form is better than the other, I also do believe the world would always be filled with a balance of both.
