2025年的2月，我將接受一個lowballed job. It pays less than my expectation, and the work is practically skill-less.
Then why did I accept the offer? Because (1) the company title still has its reputation, (2) I do not have other offers at hand, (3) I want to start working ASAP because I want to be a CEO in the future.

What do I lack to become a CEO? 用人話説，就是不夠 street-smart。不夠江湖。我希望自己儘早工作，儘早懂江湖。
