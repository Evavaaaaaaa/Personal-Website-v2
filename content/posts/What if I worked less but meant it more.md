> "Time is not a line with a before and an after. The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events." — Rovelli, The Order of Time

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about *time*. Specifically, how I use it—and how I waste it.

In the world of salaried work, the idea of an “hourly rate” feels fuzzy. But once I started viewing my time like a freelancer or a creator would, it hit differently. If I earn $X a month and work Y hours in reality, then my real hourly rate is **X divided by Y**. And that number tells a story.

Some days, that number is solid. Other days, I spend more time *dreading* a task than actually doing it. I procrastinate. I half-work while scrolling, or sit in front of my laptop without really starting. And when that happens, my actual hourly rate plummets. It's not about the money—it's about the *efficiency*, the *joy*, and honestly, the *self-respect*.

So I’ve been experimenting with a simple rule:  
**Work six real hours a day. Detach the rest.**

By "real," I mean focused, intentional time. When the six hours are done, I clock out mentally too. No more feeling guilty for not doing "more." No more pretending to work while refreshing tabs. This boundary has been surprisingly freeing. It lets me be present in both work and rest.

But there's another layer. If I want to raise my hourly rate, why stop at being efficient?  
What if I could **build once and earn repeatedly**?

That’s where digital products come in.  
One piece of work, sold many times.  
Sounds simple. Still figuring it out.

I don't have a product yet. But the seeds are there. Maybe it’s something related to my study abroad journey. Maybe templates for college applications. Or even just a thoughtful guide on how to ask for a coffee chat that’s not awkward. Something small but useful. 

Time is finite, but meaning isn’t. And if I can align my work with what feels meaningful—even if it’s small—I think that’s a win.
