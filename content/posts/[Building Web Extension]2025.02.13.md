# what i did today
I used cursor to build a web extension that could allow iframe chatgpt when reading articles online.

# why this
During my job, I need to read papers and making sure the information that the paper provides is of the latest status. Therefore, I often need to go back and forth on the web to verify the updateness of the information. 
I wanted to build a tool to decrease the friction and increase my efficiency.

# what needs to be fixed
Currently, I uses chatgpt API to fetch information. However, it seems like the API is not properly used/requested as my chatgpt accounts shows 0 usage.
