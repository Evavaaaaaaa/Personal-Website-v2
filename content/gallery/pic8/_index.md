I believe I drew this during my first year of college. I didn't want to do my homework, so I decided to draw. This one was also drawn using SAI on my laptop — it reflects my style of using SAI brushes (brushes so thick that you could see the texture) and colors (I love adding light purple here and there). I really do miss drawing with SAI. And although I don't have this hairstyle, I drew this as a self-portrait-> Just a girl chilling.
