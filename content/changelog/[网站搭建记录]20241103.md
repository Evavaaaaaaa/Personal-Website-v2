# What I Did Today

1. Edited some blog drafts under `/content/xxx.md`  
2. Pushed them to GitHub — finally uploaded some writing I had been keeping in Notion!

# What I Learned

1. **Why Zola uses so many files**

   The `templates/base.html` file uses [Tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera), which is a template engine that defines the basic layout of your site.  
   At the beginning, it imports a bunch of smaller HTML files that act like reusable components.

   This kind of **modular structure** gives you flexibility. For example, inside `base.html`, you’ll often see things like:

   ```html
   {%- block seo %} ... {%- endblock seo %}
   ```

   This tells Zola:  
   *"Hey, this section can be replaced or extended later."*

   Think of each `block` as a **placeholder**. If you don’t override it, Zola uses the default. But if you want to customize it, just create another template that extends the base, usually like this:

   ```html
   {% extends "base.html" %}
   ```

   Super flexible. Super useful. 💡

# What I Want to Do Next

1. **Change the logo!**  
   I think it’s hardcoded somewhere in `templates/partials/header.html`. I’ll probably need to replace the file path manually.  
   But first… I have to actually *draw* a logo. Hmmm 🎨

2. **Keep updating content**  
   I want to fully replace the original Abridge demo content with my own writing.

3. **Adjust the language setup**  
   Ideally, I want:
   - The site’s **base language to stay in English**
   - But blog posts to default to **Chinese**
   - And allow users to **switch to English** if they prefer

   This might be tricky because I’ll need to make sure the language settings are consistent across multiple files (like `config.toml`, file names, front matter, etc).

# Open Questions 🤔

1. **Ugly URLs for Chinese blog titles**  
   Example: `https://chanyihua.com/overview-zi-wo-cheng-chang-yu-zi-wo-wan-zheng-xing/`  
   → Can I manually change the slug or link to make it cleaner?

2. **Manual date entry is annoying**  
   I’m currently typing in the date for each `.md` file manually.  
   → Is there a way to automate this?

3. **Frequent git pushes vs batching commits**  
   Right now, I push to GitHub every time I make a small change.  
   → What are the pros and cons of doing that compared to batching multiple changes into one commit?

## ✅ Priority Right Now

I want to **focus on uploading and organizing content first**, and only then start improving formatting and templates.  
Go go go! 🚀
