# 💻 What I Did Today

I fixed a deployment bug on my website. Here’s what happened:

### 🐞 The Issue

1. Initially, the site deployed successfully and was live.
2. After some updates, Netlify still showed a successful deploy — but the website didn’t actually change.
3. Running `zola serve` locally showed the correct, updated version.

Turns out the problem was in the **Netlify build settings**:
- I hadn’t set Zola as an environment variable.
- The build command was mistakenly set to Hugo.

### 🛠️ The Fix

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard:**
   - Site settings  
   - Build & deploy  
   - Environment variables  
   - Click **"Add a variable"**

   Add the following:
   ```Key: ZOLA_VERSION Value: 0.18.0```

2. **Verify Build Settings:**
Still under **Build & deploy settings**:
- Build settings → Edit settings

Confirm these values:
```Build command: zola build Publish directory: public```
