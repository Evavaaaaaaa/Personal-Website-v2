# What Did I Do Today?

1. Added a **sidebar** (sorted by tags) for blog posts and removed the separate "Tags" page  
2. Added **navigation buttons** (Previous / Next) to both posts and gallery pages  
3. Started to **understand the logic behind HTML** (finally!)

# Why Did I Do What I Did?

### Sidebar (Tag-Based Navigation)

Before this, my blog posts were sorted by date only. It was hard to tell what topics I was writing about just by scrolling. For new visitors, that’s pretty confusing—they’d have no idea what kind of content I post.

So I built a sidebar that lists blog posts by tags. It helps with clarity and navigation.  
I might add something similar to the gallery page too.

### Navigation Buttons

This one’s simple: I wanted readers to be able to move from one post to another without going back to the homepage every time. Just a smoother reading experience overall.

# What Challenges Did I Face?

### Sidebar

- **Positioning**: At first, the sidebar showed up *below* the main content. I wanted it to sit side-by-side. So I wrapped both the content and the sidebar in a container, like this:

```html
<div class="post-container">
    <!-- Main content -->
    <article class="post-content"></article>
    <!-- Sidebar -->
    <aside class="post-sidebar"></aside>
</div>
```

- Then I styled it in `sass/blog.scss`:

```css
.post-container {
    display: flex;
    gap: 2rem;
    margin: 2rem 0;
}

.post-content {
    flex: 1;
}

.post-sidebar {
    width: 250px;
    position: sticky;
    top: 2rem;
    height: calc(100vh - 4rem);
    overflow-y: auto;
}
```

- I made sure that **all templates** used:
  1. The same class names  
  2. A `post-container` wrapper  
  3. `post-content` for main content  
  4. `post-sidebar` for the sidebar

- One hiccup: I kept getting errors because I forgot to import the `hooks` macro—needed for sidebar tag click results. Classic.

### Navigation Buttons

- Initially, the "Next" and "Previous" buttons were too close together. I fixed that… in a very silly way: just added `gap: 4rem` to `.post-navigation`.

```css
.post-navigation {
    display: flex;
    gap: 4rem;
}
```

- I was worried this fixed gap might not be responsive on different devices (hello iPhone users), so I added more flexibility:

```css
.post-navigation {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.next-post {
    flex: 1;
    min-width: 250px;
}
```

- To test responsiveness, I used the browser’s device toolbar:
  1. Right-click > Inspect  
  2. Toggle device toolbar (📱 icon)  
  3. Choose a device like iPhone or drag screen width manually

   - My code blocks look terrible (black background… why)
   - The blog text is way too big 😅
2. Fill out my **About** page
3. Collect more **website inspiration**
4. Add more content??

That’s all for today. Bit by bit, it’s coming together 🧩
