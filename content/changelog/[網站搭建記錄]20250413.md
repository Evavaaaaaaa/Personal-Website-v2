# Why Did I Do What I Did?
Trying to explore different interactions with the books I have read.

In my previous [tryouts](/changelog0326), I noticed that by just pasting annotations from boooks I've read made the blog page too long.

So I wonder if there are other ways these annotations could be presented.

# What Did I do?
I create an entire new page that does not extend the base.html. It makes the random generator looks cooler (I guess).

# What's next?
I wanted to create a RSS feed. But apparently a RSS feed that renews each day requires too much effort (because I use Zola - a static site, meaning I would need to set a new automation path to trigger RSS feed). Thus I'm still pondering whether it is worth creating a daily RSS feed.
